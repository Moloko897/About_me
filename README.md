## About Me

Hi there! I'm Moloko Catherine Chidi, a determined and self-driven IT graduate with a deep interest in cloud computing, cybersecurity, and technical problem-solving. My journey into tech began with a strong foundation in Information Technology and Computer Science at Ekurhuleni West TVET College, and I've been building on it ever since.

With hands-on experience in technical support, networking, and cloud services, I bring both practical skills and a learner’s mindset to everything I do. Whether I’m helping users configure routers or diving into cloud infrastructure challenges, I thrive on solving problems and improving systems.

I’m currently leveling up my skills through the AWS re/Start Program and have recently completed a Cybersecurity Workshop with NetCampus Group, where I gained insights into modern security threats and defense techniques. I’m excited to grow in the fields of DevOps, cybersecurity, and cloud architecture, and I’m actively working on certifications and real-world projects to back that up.
